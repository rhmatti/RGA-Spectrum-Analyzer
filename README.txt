Function:  This program provides a graphical user interface for quickly importing
	   RGA binary data files and identifying the presence/partial pressure of several of the most
	   common elements and gases.

User Instructions
-------------------------
1. Open the file "RGA Spectrum Analyzer.pyw"

2. Select the "Import" option from the File menu (File>Import) or use the shortcut <Ctrl+I>

3. Using the navigation window, navigate to an output file generated from the SRS RGA software (ending in .ana) and import it

4. Automatic Analysis:
	a) Select "Auto-Anayze" from the Analysis menu (Analysis>Auto-Analylze) or use the shortcut <Ctrl+R>
	b) A separate window will open with the results of the analysis
	c) The results will show the name of the gas, along with the partial pressure in Torr and % composition
	d) To save these results, click anywhere within the results window and use the <Ctrl+S> command
	e) The "Auto-Anayze" function searches for peak matches within a certain range of the expected mass (Î”m)
	and above a certain pressure threshold (P_min) which can be adjusted in the "Settings" (File>Settings)

5. Select a desired plot type from the "Plot" menu:
	a) Single RGA Scan:
		-Plots one RGA scan at a single instance in time from the binary data file
		-Use the navigation controls to change which scan is plotted
	b) All RGA Scans:
		-Plots all of the RGA scans from the binary data file
	c) Total Pressure Change:
		-Plots the total pressure (sum of all partial pressures) as a function of time
	d) Partial Pressure Change:
		-Plots the partial pressure of a specific gas that the user selects from the submenu
		-The gases available for selection include: Methane, H2O, Ne, N2, NO, O2, Ar, and CO2

6. To save the graph on screen, use the save icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the screen,
   select "Save" from the drop-down File menu (File>Save), or use the shortcut <Ctrl+S>
